# Oscars-Data-Science-Project

The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, are awards for
artistic and technical merit in the film industry. They are regarded by
many as the most prestigious and significant awards in the
entertainment industry worldwide.
 
Our project deals with Oscar nominees in the field of
Best Picture of the Year, In the project we are trying
to find out with the help of machine learning which
 movies will be nominees of best picture film 
Oscar's award we wanted to get best **f1_macro_score**.

we **scrap** the data about the movies from imdb site with **Beautiful**.
for the machine learning part we used **RandomForestClassifier**.
to get the hyperparameters for best **f1_macro_score** we used **GridSearchCV**.

## summery:
We wanted to see if we can detect which of the movies on imdb site will be a nominee of best picture film Oscar award.  
We should here that with a good data crewing and a good data cleaning and handling and use of random forest algorithm 
we can predict with a good assurance which movie will be a nominee of best picture film Oscar award with 0.828 f1 macro score.

Our conclusion is that a machine can not know for sure who will be the Oscar nominees, but the machine does a good job of discovering most of the films that will be Oscar nominees for the best picture of the year
